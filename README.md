## Sysfex
Another system information tool written in almost C++. I've made this thing as a hobby project. It's mostly written on C++, but some bash functions are also used inside it.<br>
It's still in develpoment, so bugs are to be expected. Feel free to open an issue. Suggestions are also appreciated<br>
Sysfex is tested on Arch linux with Xfce desktop
